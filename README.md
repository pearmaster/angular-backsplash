angular-backsplash
=================

An angular directive to fill a block element with an image.

Params:

 * **url** - Provide the url of the image to display.  This value is watched so you can change it to update the image.
 * **fade** - true, slow, or fast
 * **mode** - resize (default, aspect ratio remains the same, either the height or width equals container), stretch (aspect ratio changes so that the image fills the container), or fill (image grows proportionally to fill container, overflow is hidden)
